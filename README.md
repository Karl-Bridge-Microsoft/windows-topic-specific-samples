# Save and load ink strokes from the clipboard

> The default platform target is ARM, change this to x64 or x86 if you want to test on a non-ARM device.

This sample supports the [Pen interactions and Windows Ink](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/input-and-devices/pen-and-stylus-interactions) topics on the [Windows Dev Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows).

In this sample, we use a basic UWP application to demonstrate how to support custom processing of pen input (barrel button modifier), and copy and paste ink strokes from the clipboard.  

We focus on the following:
* Adding basic ink support
* Custom processing of pen input to support modification by the barrel button
* Saving and loading ink stroke data to/from the clipboard
