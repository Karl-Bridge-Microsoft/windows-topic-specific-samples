# Pointer input sample (UserControl with animation)

This sample supports the [Pointer input](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/input/handle-pointer-input) topic on the [Windows Dev Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows).

In this sample, we demonstrate how to track pointer input in a basic UWP application and implement a user control with animation for visual feedback. 

We focus on the following:
* Tracking multiple pointers 
* User control for visual feedback
* Animation
