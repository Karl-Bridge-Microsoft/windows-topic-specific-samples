# Save and load ink strokes from an Ink Serialized Format (ISF) file

> The default platform target is ARM, change this to x64 or x86 if you want to test on a non-ARM device.

This sample supports the [Pen interactions and Windows Ink](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/input-and-devices/pen-and-stylus-interactions) topics on the [Windows Dev Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows).

In this sample, we use a basic UWP application to demonstrate how to serialize ink data and save it to an Ink Serialized Format (ISF) file. We also show how to load ink data from an ISF file and deserialize it for display on an InkCanvas control.  

We focus on the following:
* Adding basic ink support
* Saving and loading ink stroke data to/from an ISF file
